    <p><strong>Just steps from the Irvington train station, PUSH is your escape from the crowded, chaotic gym scene.</strong></p>
    <p>We opened in 2012 with a simple idea: create a space where people actually feel comfortable working out. No judgment, no pressure, no trying to figure out if you're doing something right while someone watches from across the room (spoiler: they're not).</p>
    <p>At PUSH, it's just you and your trainer — working together in a clean, modern space that's all about real focus and real results. No noise, no egos, no distractions.</p>
    <p>Our certified trainers (NASM) work with people of all ages and fitness levels. Whether you're brand new, coming back after an injury, or training for something specific, we'll build a plan around you — your body, your goals, your schedule.</p>
    <p>This is personal training the way it should be: relaxed, supportive, and built to actually work.</p>
