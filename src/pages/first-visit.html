  	On your first visit you will fill out a health and fitness questioner. Your goals, exercise experience, medical history and schedule are all vital information. You and your trainer will discuss all of these in your initial visit. You'll talk about your lifestyle, things you're doing right and what you think needs to change, as well as strategies for making those changes realistic. Your personal trainer will take you through a warm up, then a series of assessments and movement screens. They will check for any muscle imbalances and postural deviations. Your personal trainer will then take all of the information gathered during the session and put together a program that will safely and effectively help you reach your goals, as well as address any postural deviations and muscle imbalances you may have; Because we know that being fit and healthy is more than just looking good. It's feeling good and feeling strong!
