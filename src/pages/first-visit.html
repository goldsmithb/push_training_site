    Your First Visit to PUSH
  </strong></p>

  <p>
    We start with one simple goal: understanding you. At your first visit, we take the time to learn where you’re starting from and where you want to go. This isn’t just an intro — it’s a strategy session.

        Intro Form & Goal Setting
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll fill out a short intro form so we can understand your goals, fitness background, and anything else we need to know to help you succeed.

        We’ll take that information and talk through your current lifestyle, what’s working, what’s not, and what changes feel realistic. This is a judgment-free zone — we’re here to help, not lecture.

        Movement Screens & Assessments
      </p>
      <p>
        Your trainer will guide you through a warm-up and a series of movement assessments to identify muscle imbalances, mobility issues, or postural deviations. This ensures we train you safely and effectively.

        Customized Program Design
      </p>
      <p>
        After your session, we’ll take everything we’ve learned and build a personalized program tailored to your goals, needs, and body mechanics. Every rep, every movement, will have a purpose.

    Because getting fit isn’t just about looking better — it’s about moving better, feeling stronger, and building something that lasts. “This is the longest I’ve ever stuck with this” — we hear that more than you’d think.
